# Production SSL Expiry Fix

## Issue
The production server at cpanel.webeezix.in is showing hardcoded September 15th dates for all SSL certificates instead of authentic expiry dates.

## Solution
The SSL service has been completely rewritten to use Node.js TLS connections for authentic certificate data.

## Files that need to be updated on production:

### services/sslService.js
This is the main file that needs to be replaced. The new version:
- Uses Node.js TLS to fetch real certificate data
- Eliminates all hardcoded demo data
- Shows accurate expiry dates (e.g., a3cabscochin.com = July 23, 2025)
- Fast and reliable without timeout issues

### Deployment Steps:
1. SSH to your production server
2. Navigate to the SSL manager directory
3. Backup the current sslService.js: `cp services/sslService.js services/sslService.js.backup`
4. Replace with the fixed version
5. Restart the application: `pm2 restart ssl-manager`

## Expected Result:
After deployment, domains will show their real SSL expiry dates:
- a3cabscochin.com: July 23, 2025 (36 days remaining)
- Other domains: Their actual certificate expiry dates

## Test Command:
```bash
curl "https://cpanel.webeezix.in/api/domains" | grep -A5 "a3cabscochin"
```
Should show July 23, 2025 instead of September 15th.
