# Domain Deletion - Fixed Implementation

## What's Been Fixed

The domain deletion process now properly removes all files and SSL certificates with comprehensive verification.

## Fixed Deletion Process

### Step-by-Step Deletion:

1. **SSL Certificate Removal** (if requested)
   - Lists all certificates using `certbot certificates`
   - Finds certificates matching the domain or www.domain
   - Removes all matching certificates by name
   - Handles multiple certificate names properly

2. **Symbolic Link Removal**
   - Removes `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/domain.com`
   - Verifies file exists before attempting removal
   - Logs success/failure appropriately

3. **Configuration File Removal**
   - Removes `/etc/nginx/sites-available/domain.com`
   - Verifies file exists before attempting removal
   - Throws error if removal fails (critical step)

4. **Nginx Configuration Test**
   - Tests nginx configuration for syntax errors
   - Ensures no broken configurations remain

5. **Nginx Reload**
   - Reloads nginx to apply changes
   - Confirms nginx is running properly

6. **Verification**
   - Checks that configuration files are actually removed
   - Confirms symbolic links no longer exist
   - Provides detailed deletion report

## API Response Example

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Domain example.com deleted successfully",
  "domain": "example.com",
  "ssl": {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Successfully removed 1 SSL certificate(s) for example.com",
    "removedCertificates": ["example.com"]
  },
  "deletionSteps": [
    "SSL certificate removed: Successfully removed 1 SSL certificate(s) for example.com",
    "Symbolic link removed: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com",
    "Configuration file removed: /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com",
    "Nginx configuration test: PASSED",
    "Nginx reload: SUCCESS",
    "Verification: Configuration file successfully removed",
    "Verification: Symbolic link successfully removed"
  ],
  "filesRemoved": {
    "configFile": "/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com",
    "symbolicLink": "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com"
  }
}
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Add a test domain:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/api/domains" \
  -H "Authorization: auth-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "test.com", "installSSL": true, "email": "admin@test.com"}'
```

2. **Delete the domain with SSL removal:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/api/domains/test.com?removeSSL=true" \
  -H "Authorization: auth-token"
```

3. **Verify files are removed:**
```bash
# Check that files no longer exist
ls -la /etc/nginx/sites-available/test.com  # Should show "No such file"
ls -la /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/test.com    # Should show "No such file"

# Check SSL certificates
certbot certificates | grep test.com        # Should show no results
```

## Error Handling

The improved deletion handles these scenarios:

- **SSL certificate not found**: Continues with file deletion
- **Configuration file already removed**: Logs and continues
- **Symbolic link missing**: Logs and continues
- **Nginx configuration errors**: Stops deletion and reports error
- **Permission errors**: Reports detailed error information

## Console Logging

Detailed logging shows each step:

```
Starting domain deletion process for test.com...
Step 1: Removing SSL certificate for test.com...
Attempting to remove SSL certificate for test.com
Looking for SSL certificates for test.com...
Removing certificate: test.com
Successfully removed certificate: test.com
✓ SSL certificate removal completed for test.com
Step 2: Removing symbolic link: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/test.com
✓ Symbolic link removed: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/test.com
Step 3: Removing configuration file: /etc/nginx/sites-available/test.com
✓ Configuration file removed: /etc/nginx/sites-available/test.com
Step 4: Testing nginx configuration...
✓ Nginx configuration test passed
Step 5: Reloading nginx...
✓ Nginx reloaded successfully
Step 6: Verifying domain deletion...
✓ Verification passed: Configuration file no longer exists
✓ Verification passed: Symbolic link no longer exists
✅ Domain deletion completed successfully for test.com
```

The domain deletion now completely removes all traces of the domain from your server, including configuration files, symbolic links, and SSL certificates.
