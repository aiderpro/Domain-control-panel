# SSL Detection Fix - Production Deployment

## Critical Issues Identified

1. **Backend SSL Detection Problem**: The production server is using `sslService.getDemoSSLStatus()` which returns fake demo data instead of checking real SSL certificates.

2. **Page Reload Issue**: Frontend waits for socket connection before loading domains, causing stuck loader on refresh.

## Required Production Server Updates

### 1. Replace domains.js with SSL Detection Fix

The current production domains.js file needs to be replaced with `working-domains.js` which includes:

- Real SSL status detection based on nginx configuration
- Proper checking of `hasSSLConfig`, `sslCertificate`, and port 443
- Fallback to nginx config analysis when SSL service fails
- Correct SSL status for domains with certificates

### 2. Current SSL Status Problems

From production API response:
- `ssltest.eezix.com`: Has SSL cert paths but shows "no_ssl"
- `ssltesting.eezix.com`: Has SSL cert paths but shows "no_ssl"
- Only `example.com` correctly shows SSL status

### 3. Frontend Fixes Deployed

- Fixed page reload loader issue by ensuring DOM structure exists
- Enhanced SSL status detection logic
- Improved error handling for missing containers

## Deployment Steps

1. **SSH to production server**
2. **Navigate to**: `/var/www/nginx-control-panel/routes/`
3. **Backup current file**: `cp domains.js domains.js.backup`
4. **Replace with corrected version**: Copy content from `working-domains.js`
5. **Restart service**: Kill node process and restart

## Expected Results After Fix

- Domains with SSL certificates will show "Active SSL" status
- SSL expiry dates will display for certificates
- Page reload will load domains immediately
- No more stuck loader on refresh

The SSL detection will properly identify certificates based on nginx configuration and certificate file paths.
